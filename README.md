# üêæ Animal Image Classification with Custom CNN

A deep learning project that classifies animal images using a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in **PyTorch**.  
The model was trained with advanced techniques such as **data augmentation**, **AdamW optimizer**, and **learning rate scheduling (ReduceLROnPlateau)** to achieve high accuracy.
